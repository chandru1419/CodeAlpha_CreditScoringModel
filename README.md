# Credit Scoring Model  
CodeAlpha – Machine Learning Internship (Task 1)

## Project Overview
This project implements a Credit Scoring Model using machine learning to predict an individual’s credit risk based on historical financial and personal data.  
The model can help financial institutions make informed decisions on loan approvals.

## Objective
To build a supervised machine learning classification model that categorizes customers as:
- Good Credit Risk  
- Bad Credit Risk  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas for data handling  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Matplotlib for visualization  

## Methodology
- Loaded the credit risk dataset  
- Handled missing values in numerical features  
- Converted categorical features into numerical format using encoding  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Applied feature scaling  
- Trained a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluated the model using standard classification metrics  

## Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- ROC-AUC score  
- Confusion Matrix visualization  

These metrics help measure how effectively the model distinguishes between good and bad credit applicants.

## Results
The trained model demonstrates good predictive performance and is able to classify credit risk effectively based on the given features.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:  
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
2. Place the dataset in the project folder  
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook
